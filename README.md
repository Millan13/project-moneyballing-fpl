# Moneyballing Fantasy Premier League


## The Motivation

### An Introduction to FPL

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is an online game that follows the real-life Premier League Football season. Given a virtual budget of £100m, each ‘manager’ has to assemble a team of players, who score FPL points based on their performance in real life games.

Famous players who scored highly in previous seasons are more expensive. Therefore, good FPL managers are those able to spot cheap, unknown players with the potential to score big.

Managers can swap one player from their team every week to bring in a replacement (who may be in better form, or have an easier run of fixtures).

### 'Differential Players'

The most sought-after players in FPL are known as 'differentials'. Differential players are those owned by a small number of FPL managers. Consistently picking ‘differentials’ is key to FPL success – if you own a high-scoring player, this isn’t overly advantageous if the same player is owned by 50% of managers.

Data confirms that there are such ‘differential’ players in the game (though they are in the minority, often making them hard to spot).

Of course, every football match generates a lot of data – both in terms of player performance and FPL manager decisions. The aim of this project, therefore, is to create a suite of tools that help managers make better picks throughout the season (namely picking better differentials), based on the data.


## The Technologies Used

* Requests and Splinter for API calls and webscraping
* Pandas for data munging
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation
* Tableau for Dashboard generation
* Scikit-learn for Decision Trees / Random Forests
* XGboost for ensemble method learning
* Keras for deep learning


## Data Gathering

### The Data Sources

The data for this project comes from two places:

1. **The official FPL API.** This gives us a lot 'first principles' data, such as basic data about each team and player in the game, as well as information about the FPL game itself, such as the number of managers choosing each player each week, and the number of FPL points that each player scores.

2. **Scraping the Premier League website.** We are able to scrape commentary (as well as some other aggregated data) straight from the Premier League website. This gives us a detailed view of every event that happened in every game. A full explanation of how this data was scraped can be found here: https://towardsdatascience.com/improve-your-data-wrangling-with-object-oriented-programming-914d3ebc83a9

All of the data was uploaded into an SQLite database.

### Munging The Data

Getting the data from its initial string-based form into something we could actually use required significant data wrangling. In particular, we utilised OOP, creating 'Match' and 'Event' classes.

By instantiating each commentary text string as an 'Event' object, we were able to extract key information:

* What time in the game did the event happen?
* Which players were involved
* What was the outcome of the event
* etc.

Building back up, we were able to instantiate a 'Match' object from a dictionary of scraped data, then perform methods on that object to extract full tables of stats.

## Observations

Having scraped data for over 10,000 shots across over 400 matches, we can start to see some patterns emerging.

### Where Do FPL Points Come From?

If the aim of the analysis is to maximise the number of FPL points scored by a manager's fantasy team, it's a good idea to see where these points come from.

The first thing to note is that the share of points earned by position reflects the number of players of each position. Therefore there's no intrinsic reason to favour one position over another when selecting a team (besides, there are minimum and maximum numbers of players of each position that a team can have).

![PointsByPosition](https://github.com/calbal91/project-moneyballing-fpl/blob/master/Images/PointsByPosition.png)

More than half of FPL points are generated by ‘Minutes Played’, i.e. players simply being selected to play. Keeping clean sheets and scoring goals are the most common ways to generate extra points - thus FPL managers need to be mindful of both attack and defence.

### Network Analysis

We can use our shots data to identify 'important' players.

For example, we can see what share of their teams' shots (and goals) each player has been involved in.

![ShareOfShots](https://github.com/calbal91/project-moneyballing-fpl/blob/master/Images/ShareOfShots.png)

And we can look at the pairs of players who have assisted each other's shots the most:

![PlayerPairs](https://github.com/calbal91/project-moneyballing-fpl/blob/master/Images/PlayerPairs.png)

#### Team Graphs

We can get more scientific. Let’s think of each team as its own ‘social network’. Then we can think of each player as a node within the network for their respective teams. The weight of the ‘edges’ between each pair of nodes can then be defined by the number of times that those two players have assisted each other’s shots.

So for Manchester City, the league's highest goalscorers so far, such a network looks like this:

![MCFCNetwork](https://github.com/calbal91/project-moneyballing-fpl/blob/master/Images/NetworkMC.png)

And for Wolves, who have a lot of prolific player pairs, we can see a tight 'sub-graph' of attacking players (as expected):

![WolvesNetwork](https://github.com/calbal91/project-moneyballing-fpl/blob/master/Images/NetworkWO.png)

#### Node Centrality

Of course, just eyeballing a visualisation isn’t especially rigorous. We can instead use ‘weighted betweenness’ to enumerate how ‘central’ a node is within a network (and hence how important the player is to their team).

In a given network, betweenness quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. In other words, to calculate Kevin De Bruyne’s ‘betweenness’, we calculate the shortest possible ‘journeys’ between every pair of players in the Manchester City network. We then calculate the share of those ‘journeys’ that pass through the De Bruyne node.

This betweenness metric can account for edge weights. In particular, we can say that the edge between two players who assist each other a lot is ‘shorter’ than other edges. The shortest path between a given pair of nodes is, of course, likelier to use these short edges, therefore players with high goal involvement will feature on more of these shortest paths, and have higher levels of betweenness.

*For the purposes of these calculations, we can say that the length of the edge between two players is the inverse of (i.e. 1 divided by) the number of times that they assisted each other. The ‘shortest path’ between each node pair is then calculated using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.*

We can then use this to see who the most 'important' players in the league are...

... and who the most important players are for each team.
